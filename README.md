# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Prediction of human activity has become more valuable in daily life. Providing accurate information based on peopleâ€™s activities and behaviours can help in health, medical, security, entertainment and many scenes that are closely related to people's lives. Human activity recognition systems have been an active field in the past with the relevant features extracted from wearable sensors.

With the emergence of deep learning and increased computation power, machine learning and deep learning are becoming more and more popular in classifying human activities.
Our human activity recognition model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks approach. The method was tested based on wearable sensors from Movement Analysis in Real-world Environments using Accelerometers (MAREA). It can predict user activity based on the historical data to further improve the activity classification. The performance is further compared with algorithms like XGBoost and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to see the difference.
